        <p>
            Maki sushi is made by layering a sheet of seaweed with vinegared rice 
            and fillings. It’s firmly rolled into thin tubes and sliced into bite-sized 
            pieces. When you look at a slice of maki sushi, you’ll see fillings on the 
            inside, a coating of sticky rice, and a covering of thin seaweed paper (nori).

            <li>55ml Sushi vinegar</li>
            <li>Nori sheets</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Filling Ingredients Idea</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Cucumber batons</li>
            <li>Red pepper batons</li>
            <li>Avacado cut into strips</li>
            <li>Sashimi grade tuna or salmon</li>
            <li>Pickled daikon radish</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Method</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the rice in cold water and drain. Place water and rice into a cold pan, and bring to the boil. Lower heat to a very gentle simmer for 10-15 minutes. Keep checking to make sure it doesn’t boil dry.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, cover, and leave to stand for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour into a wide dish, add the sushi vinegar, and keep mixing until cool.</li>
            <li>Lay the bamboo mat in front of you, with the struts lying parallel to the edge of the work surface. Place a sheet of nori seaweed on top with the long side in line with the struts.</li>
            <li>Using damp fingers, scoop a little rice onto the nori sheet. Pat out the rice with finger tips, leaving the centimetre furthest away from you bare. This will overlap to seal the roll. The rice layer should be around half a centimetre thick.</li>
            <li>Place the chosen filling in a line along the edge of the rice closest to you. Lift the sushi mat with your thumbs, holding the fillings close with your fingers, and push forward firmly - lift and roll the rice away from you, to form a firm cylinder. Press to seal.</li>
            <li>Using a sharp knife, slice into 6 to 8 bite-sized pieces just before serving. Serve with soy sauce on the side, a little wasabi paste, and sushi ginger to cleanse the palate.</li>
        </ol>
